 ## A test project in a company that I've been applying for, I just thought it's challenging and fun to solve.
 
It has a background worker that runs in a specified interval (cycle time) (this is configured using appsettings.json)
Has a URL management service
You can add the url to the json file or you can add it individually using the REST API enpoint
 TODO: Add a file watcher on the json file 
       Add an enpoint to query all the results
